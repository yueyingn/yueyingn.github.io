<p>
  I am a fourth year PhD student from the McWilliams Center for Cosmology at Carnegie Mellon University, working with Professor Tiziana Di Matteo. My main research interest is to use cosmological hydrodynamic simulation to study the evolution of galaxies and their supermassive black holes (SMBHs). I am especially interested in the environmental effect on the growth of early quasars, effects of AGN feedback on galaxy evolution, and the dynamics of SMBHs. I am also engaged in applying deep learning method on cosmological simulation. We are currently working on super resolution simulations that produce high-resolution realizations conditioned on low resolution simulation output. Besides, I also work on astrophysical probes on alternative dark matter models.
