<p>
  I am a fourth year PhD student from the McWilliams Center for Cosmology at Carnegie Mellon University, working with Professor Tiziana Di Matteo. My main research interest is to use cosmological hydrodynamic simulation to study the evolution of galaxies and the supermassive black holes (SMBHs). I am especially interested in the environmental effects on the growth of early quasars, AGN feedback on galaxy evolution, and the dynamics of SMBHs. I am also engaged in applying deep learning method on cosmological simulation. I am currently working on super resolution simulations that use generative model to produce high-resolution realizations conditioned on low resolution simulation output. Besides, I also work on astrophysical probes on alternative dark matter models.
