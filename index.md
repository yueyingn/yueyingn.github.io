  I am a fifth year PhD student from the McWilliams Center for Cosmology at Carnegie Mellon University, working with Professor Tiziana DiMatteo. My research work has mainly focused on three areas. First, I carry out large cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, as well as develop numerical simulation codes, to study the evolution of quasars and galaxies over the cosmic history. I am especially interested in how the large scale structures impact the early quasar growth, the local host environment of quasars, the effect of AGN feedback, as well as the dynamics of SMBHs. Second, I apply super-resolution techniques in cosmological simulations to model the small-scale structures and astrophysical processes using deep learning method. In particular, I train generative models to produce high-resolution realizations of cosmological simulations from the low resolution simulations. Finally, I also work on astrophysical probes of alternative dark matter models using cosmological simulations.
