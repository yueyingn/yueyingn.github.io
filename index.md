<p>
I am an ITC postdoctoral fellow at Harvardâ€“Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. My research interests span multiple fields in astrophysics and cosmology. I carry out large cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, as well as develop numerical simulation codes, to study the evolution of quasars and galaxies over cosmic history. I am especially interested in how the large scale structures impact early quasar growth, the local host environment of quasars, the effect of AGN feedback on galaxy formation, as well as the dynamics of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and massive black hole mergers. Moreover, I actively work on machine learning applications in cosmology. I established super-resolution techniques in cosmological simulations to resolve the small-scale structures and astrophysical processes using deep learning models. Beyond, I also work on astrophysical probes of alternative dark matter models using cosmological simulations.
