Brief introductions for some of my projects.

<br />
We are doing a new large volume cosmological hydrodymical simulation run with $2 \times 5500^3$ particles in 250 Mpc/$h$ volume box on Frontera supercomputer. The simulation includes new implementations of supermassive black hole physics, stellar metal return model and reionization models.

## Super-resolution simulation

<br />
We apply the novel generative model to produce high-resolution realizations of cosmological simulations conditioned on the low-resolution dark matter field.
